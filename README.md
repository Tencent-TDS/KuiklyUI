## Introduction
`Kuikly` is a comprehensive cross-platform solution for UI and logic based on Kotlin multi-platform. It was launched by Tencent's company-level Oteam in the front-end field. It aims to provide a `high-performance, full-platform development framework with unified codebase, ultimate ease of use, and dynamic flexibility`. Currently supported platforms:
- [X] Android
- [X] iOS
- [ ] HarmonyOS(Open-source in May)
- [ ] Web (Open-source in Q2)
- [ ] Mini Programs (Open-source in Q2)

Since its launch, `Kuikly` has gained wide recognition from the business. It has been used by many products such as QQ, QQ Music, QQ Browser, Tencent News, Sogou Input Method, MyApp Hub(Tencent's app store), WeSing, Kugou Music, Kuwo Music, Tencent Self-selected Stock, ima.copilot, Weishi, etc.
## Key Features

- **Cross-platform:** Kotlin-based implementation ensuring consistent operation across multiple platforms - one codebase, five platforms
- **Native performance:** Generates platform-native binaries (.aar/.framework)
- **Native development experience:** Native UI rendering, native toolchain support, Kotlin as primary language
- **Lightweight:** Minimal SDK footprint (AOT mode: ~300KB for Android, ~1.2MB for iOS)
- **Dynamic capability:** Supports compilation into dynamic deliverables
- **Multiple paradigms:** Supports both declarative & reactive programming, with self-developed DSL and Compose DSL (under development).

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start](https://kuikly.tds.qq.com/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B/hello-world.html)
- [Integration Guide](https://kuikly.tds.qq.com/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B/overview.html)
- [Component Features](https://kuikly.tds.qq.com/API/%E7%BB%84%E4%BB%B6/override.html)

## Building from Source
### Environment Setup
Refer to [Environment Configuration](https://kuikly.tds.qq.com/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B/env-setup.html)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

    if your Android Studio Version >= (2024.2.1) Please switch your Gradle JDK Version to JDK17
    (this Version default Gradle JDK is 21, it incompatible with the configuration used by the project)

    Android Studio -> Settings -> Build,Execution,Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Gradle JDK
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/)
- JDK17

### Running Android App
Ensure environment preparation is complete before building:
1. Open `KuiklyUI` root directory in `Android Studio` and sync project
2. Select androidApp configuration, then Run 'androidApp'

### Running iOS App
Ensure environment preparation is complete before building:
1. Navigate to `iosApp` directory
2. Execute `pod install --repo-update`
3. Open `KuiklyUI` root directory in Android Studio and sync project
4. Select iOSApp configuration, then Run 'iOSApp'

Alternatively, open KuiklyUI/iosApp in Xcode and Run

> Note: The iosApp project will execute the KMP script when compiling. If you encounter an error with the script read and write file permissions, you need to set `User Script Sandboxing` to `No` in `Xcode -> Build Setting`.

### Kotlin Version Support
The KuiklyUI directory contains Gradle configurations for various `Kotlin versions`:

Naming convention: `x.x.xx.gradle.kts` (default uses Kotlin 1.7.20)

Test publishing scripts for each version are available as `x.x.xx_test_publish.sh` for building local artifacts.

> Note: Kotlin 1.3.10/1.4.20 require JDK11

After successful build on any platform, you can modify Core, Render, and Demo to experience `Kuikly` development.
